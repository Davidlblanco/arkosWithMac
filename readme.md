* **1 - Donwload the latests compatible version of Arkos here:**
    https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki    

    1.1 - i am actually using this one:
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-djugu1zFRs1XQBauNxRS25IJXsPAL-9/view
    
    *you might need a program of your choice to unzip it*
    

* **2 - Download balenaEtcher to flash the sd card with Arkos:**
    https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher
    
    https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/releases/download/v1.18.11/balenaEtcher-1.18.11.dmg
    
    note: I tried to do this stap by only using disk utility but didn't succeed 

* **3 - Before inserting the sd card in the console, go to the boot directory and change this file:**
